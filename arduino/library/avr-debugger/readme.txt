avr_debug

This library provides source level debugger for Arduino Uno and Mega. 
This debugger can be used to step through your code, place breakpoints, view variables etc. 
No external hardware is needed. 
Supports Arduino UNO and MEGA.
Created by Jan Dolinay.

This library is part of larger project, see https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1037057/Debugger-for-Arduino
and https://github.com/jdolinay/avr_debug


Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Debugging requires IDE with debugging capabilities, for example, Visual Studio Code. 
This cannot be used with Arduino IDE! 


Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To install this library, just place this entire folder as a subfolder in your
Arduino/libraries folder (This folder is in Documents on Windows)


Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: This library cannot be used with Arduino IDE. It requires IDE with debugging capabilities, for example, Visual Studio Code or eclipse.

Windows instructions:
- Add this library to your sketch
- Put call to debug_init(); into your setup() function.
- In file manager copy the provided launch.json file to your-sketsch-location/.vscode folder. 
- Change the number of COM port to the number where your arduino is connected - see "miDebuggerServerAddress": in launch.json
- Change the location of avr-gdb.exe. The default will work only if you installed Arduino IDE to default location.   
Default path: "c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Arduino\\hardware\\tools\\avr\\bin\\avr-gdb.exe"
see "miDebuggerPath":

Optional, but highly recommended step: 
- copy platform.local.txt to your-arduino-directory/hardware/arduino/avr
Default location: c:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\hardware\arduino\avr\
Important note: this affects all programs you build in Arduino IDE or VS code! 
This will modify the build settings so that the program is easier to debug (turn of compiler optimizations).
The code will also be larger. For building the final program remove or rename the platform.local.txt file. 
This will make your program smaller and faster.


Breakpoints in FLASH memory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By default the debugger in in basic configuration, which I call "RAM breakpoints". 
The advantage of this configuration is that you donâ€™t need to do anything with the Arduino board, just add library to your program. 
The disadvantage is that the program runs at much slower speed when debugged. 

To overcome this disadvantage you can switch to "Flash breakpoints", but this requires updating bootloader in your Arduino board.
For Arduino Uno and other boards using ATmega328 you can use special bootloader provided with this library.
You can find it in the bootloader subfolder of the library and burn it into your Arduino. 

As another option for ATmega328 and as the only option for the other boards you can use OPTIBOOT bootloader version 8.0 and higher.
After updating the bootloader open the avr8-stub.h file change AVR8_BREAKPOINT_MODE from 1 to 0 or 2 depending on the bootloader.
For detailed instructions please see the documentation for the avr_gdb debugger -  https://github.com/jdolinay/avr_debug. 
Look into the doc folder - avr_debug.pdf.



Linux and Mac instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I hope you can figure it out based on the instructions above. 
Some instructions are provided in the doc file in https://github.com/jdolinay/avr_debug.
